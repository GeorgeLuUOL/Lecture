# Portfolio Document
## 1. Introduction
The document mainly describes the implementation of the COMP327 Assignment 03. The assignment contains the implementation of all lab exercises of the module and how they are used in the assignment02.

## 2. Implementation
In this part, the document will describe the implementation of these exercises.
* Lab 03: Implementation of a basic swift application using UIViewController.

* Lab 04: Implementation of a table application using UITableViewController.

* Lab 05: Implementation of an application with locally stored data.

* Lab 06: Implementation of a Map application using MKMapDelegent.

* Lab 08: Implementation of the layout mechanisms.

## 3. With Assignment 02
Multiple technologies introduced in these lab exercises are used to implement the assignment02.
* The mechanism about table used in lab 04's exercise is used to implement the artwork table.

* The mechanism about the core data in lab 05's exercise is used to implement the local data storage of the application.

* The mechanisms about map view, annotation and click-event on an annotation in lab 06's exercise are used to implement the map of the application.
